TOPIC: Negative Thinking / Depression
STRATEGY: Identify "All-or-Nothing Thinking"
CONTENT: This distortion involves viewing situations as either all "good" or all "bad," with no middle ground. For example, believing that if you aren't perfect, you are a total failure. Challenge this by asking: "Am I looking at this situation in black and white? What is the gray area?"

TOPIC: Anxiety / Worry
STRATEGY: Identify "Catastrophizing"
CONTENT: This involves assuming the worst possible outcome will happen. For example, thinking "If I fail this test, I will never get a job." Challenge this by asking: "What is the most likely outcome? Has this worst-case scenario happened before? Can I cope even if it does?"

TOPIC: Self-Criticism
STRATEGY: Identify "Should Statements"
CONTENT: Using "should", "must", or "ought" leads to guilt and frustration when directed at yourself. For example, "I should have exercised today." Replace these with preferences: "It would have been nice to exercise, but I can try again tomorrow."

TOPIC: Low Self-Esteem
STRATEGY: Identify "Mental Filtering"
CONTENT: This involves focusing exclusively on negative details while ignoring all positive evidence. For example, dwelling on one critical comment while ignoring ten compliments. Challenge this by asking: "Am I filtering out the positives? What went well today?"

TOPIC: Overwhelmed / Panic
STRATEGY: The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique
CONTENT: Acknowledge 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This brings your focus to the present moment and reduces physiological arousal.

TOPIC: High Stress
STRATEGY: Box Breathing
CONTENT: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system to calm the fight-or-flight response.

TOPIC: Anger / Frustration
STRATEGY: Temperature Change (TIP Skill)
CONTENT: Splash cold water on your face or hold an ice cube for 30 seconds. Intense cold triggers the "Mammalian Dive Reflex," which instantly slows your heart rate and cools down intense emotions.

TOPIC: Sadness / Lethargy
STRATEGY: Opposite Action
CONTENT: If you feel like isolating, do the opposite: reach out to a friend. If you feel like staying in bed, do the opposite: stand up and walk for 5 minutes. Action changes emotion.

TOPIC: Chronic Worry
STRATEGY: "Worry Time" Technique
CONTENT: Set aside 20 minutes each day (e.g., 5 PM) as your designated "Worry Time." If a worry pops up during the day, write it down and tell yourself: "I will worry about this at 5 PM." Often, by the time 5 PM comes, the worry feels less urgent.

TOPIC: Problem Solving
STRATEGY: The "Control" Circle
CONTENT: Draw a circle. Inside, write things you can control (your actions, your words). Outside, write things you cannot control (others' opinions, the past, the weather). Focus your energy only on what is inside the circle.
